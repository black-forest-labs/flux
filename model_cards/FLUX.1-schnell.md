![FLUX.1 [schnell] Grid](../assets/schnell_grid.jpg)

`FLUX.1 [schnell]` is a 12 billion parameter rectified flow transformer capable of generating images from text descriptions.
For more information, please read our [blog post](https://blackforestlabs.ai/announcing-black-forest-labs/).

# Key Features
1. Cutting-edge output quality and competitive prompt following, matching the performance of closed source alternatives.
2. Trained using latent adversarial diffusion distillation, `FLUX.1 [schnell]` can generate high-quality images in only 1 to 4 steps.
3. Released under the `apache-2.0` licence, the model can be used for personal, scientific, and commercial purposes.

# Usage
We provide a reference implementation of `FLUX.1 [schnell]`, as well as sampling code, in a dedicated [github repository](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux).
Developers and creatives looking to build on top of `FLUX.1 [schnell]` are encouraged to use this as a starting point.

## API Endpoints
The FLUX.1 models are also available via API from the following sources
1. [bfl.ml](https://docs.bfl.ml/) (currently `FLUX.1 [pro]`)
2. [replicate.com](https://replicate.com/collections/flux)
3. [fal.ai](https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/flux/schnell)

## ComfyUI
`FLUX.1 [schnell]` is also available in [Comfy UI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) for local inference with a node-based workflow.

# Limitations
- This model is not intended or able to provide factual information.
- As a statistical model this checkpoint might amplify existing societal biases.
- The model may fail to generate output that matches the prompts.
- Prompt following is heavily influenced by the prompting-style.

# Out-of-Scope Use
The model and its derivatives may not be used

- In any way that violates any applicable national, federal, state, local or international law or regulation.
- For the purpose of exploiting, harming or attempting to exploit or harm minors in any way; including but not limited to the solicitation, creation, acquisition, or dissemination of child exploitative content.
- To generate or disseminate verifiably false information and/or content with the purpose of harming others.
- To generate or disseminate personal identifiable information that can be used to harm an individual.
- To harass, abuse, threaten, stalk, or bully individuals or groups of individuals.
- To create non-consensual nudity or illegal pornographic content.
